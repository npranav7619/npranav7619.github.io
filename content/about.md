N.Pranav Krishna
----

 Undergrad at BITS Pilani, fueled by coffee and a knack for finding loopholes (not just in code). On a quest to absorb every byte of knowledge, especially in Cybersecurity, where I'm known for my talent in finding the 'unGoogleable'. Fuzzing, IoT vulnerabilities, and conquering Capture The Flag competitions are my bread and butterâ€”I've even clinched first place in a couple! But beyond the cyber fray, you'll find me lost in the epic saga of Star Wars, fuelled by a perpetual stream of coffee. With a background in electronics and instrumentation, I've seamlessly transitioned into my true passion: cyber security. Always on the lookout for new research projects, I thrive on unraveling its complexities. And let's not forget my love affair with peanut butterâ€”perfect for those late-night coding sessions. From reverse-engineering pcapng files to analyzing images, I've delved into a diverse array of tech projects, including crafting Twitter clones and engineering Python libraries for PLCs. So whether we're swapping cyber tales, dissecting Star Wars lore, or sharing a virtual cup of coffee, I'm thrilled to have you join me on this digital adventure!
